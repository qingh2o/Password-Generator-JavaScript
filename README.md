# Password-Generator-JavaScript
Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description 

This Console-Finances was created for bootcamp students who were taking the fifth week's challenge. In this challenge, my task was to create an application where users can generate random passwords based on the criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

The password generator application must meet the following critical requirements:
* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
* The application should not produce any errors in the console when you inspect it using Chrome DevTools.
