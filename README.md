Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description 

This Console-Finances was created for bootcamp students who were taking the fifth week's challenge. In this challenge, my task was to create an application where users can generate random passwords based on the criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

The password generator application must meet the following critical requirements:
* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password: 8 to 128 characters
    * Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Validate each input; ensure at least one character type is selected
  * After answering prompts, display the generated password in an alert or on the page.
* Ensure the application is error-free in Chrome DevTools inspection.
